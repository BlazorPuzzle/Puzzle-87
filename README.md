## The Challenge

This is a .NET 9 Blazor Web App with Global Interactivity

We are trying to implement drag and drop within a list of Blazor Puzzle Episodes

It looks like it should work. We get no errors. Dragging does indeed start when you grab a drag handle, but it does not allow you to drop.

How can we make this work?
